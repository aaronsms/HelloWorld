# Motivation

Our team has seen similar applications that aims to provide language learners
a platform to be able to source credible tutors, like Italki. 

However, when we look into the forum, we see that there are a lot of users who 
are looking for other users to practice speaking in the language they are
trying to master. Looking for someone with the same language goals that can
communicate in a comfortable language is not easy. Several users even included 
video conference links like Skype to hopefully meet up with someone online to 
practice the language together.

Thus, our team hopes to provide a more integrative and seamless experience to
many users who are looking for such alternatives, that is we wish to provide

# Technologies

Our team decided to use Flutter mainly due to its cross-platform compatibility 
for both IOS and Android, as well as its great tooling and high performance. 
We also aim to leave our options open for web development by capitalizing on
Flutter's web compatibility. 

Naturally, we use Dart, which is the language Flutter is based in, to handle
the business logic and orchestrate the backend component.

We chose not to use Firebase as we value scalability and customizability.
Despite being a convenient solution, we want our app to remain flexible and
migration-friendly. So we decided to go with MySQL for user information and
MongoDB to store messages and conversations at scale.
